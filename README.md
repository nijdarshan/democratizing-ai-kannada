# Democratizing AI x Kannada (Work in Progress)

## Overview

**Democratizing AI x Kannada** is an ongoing project aimed at bringing the power of AI, specifically in Natural Language Processing (NLP), to the Kannada language. Kannada, like many other regional languages, often lacks the rich datasets and resources available for languages such as English, French, or German. This project seeks to bridge that gap by creating and training AI models that can effectively process and understand Kannada.

Our goal is to make cutting-edge AI accessible for low-resource languages like Kannada by leveraging existing NLP technologies. The focus is on developing tools that can transfer NLP models successfully across languages, enhancing the linguistic capabilities and accessibility of AI for a broader audience.

## Motivation

The project draws inspiration from several key ideas:

- **Democratizing AI**: Making AI accessible to all, including speakers of underrepresented languages like Kannada.
- **Local Patriotism**: Creating resources for the Kannada language, motivated by a deep sense of cultural identity.
- **Social Justice**: Bridging the linguistic divide by ensuring that AI advancements benefit speakers of low-resource languages.
- **Academic and Industry Recognition**: Positioning contributors as pioneers in this growing field, both in academia and industry.

## Research Focus

The core research questions guiding this project include:

- **Can NLP models transfer effectively to Kannada?**: We are exploring how well existing NLP models (trained on high-resource languages) perform on Kannada datasets. The project employs methods like zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot learning to test the models' transfer capabilities.
  
- **How can we improve NLP models for Kannada?**: This aspect dives into techniques to fine-tune and adapt NLP models, ensuring better performance for Kannada text processing.
  
- **What can we learn from this cross-lingual perspective?**: Beyond practical applications, we aim to contribute to broader NLP research by uncovering linguistic insights that can improve understanding of language structures.

## Key Project Stages

Though detailed processes are yet to be shared, the project is organized into the following high-level stages:

1. **Dataset Development**: Building a robust dataset of polysemous words in Kannada through various resources, ensuring the dataset is curated with linguistic accuracy and relevance.
2. **Training and Testing Models**: Adapting existing NLP models to work on Kannada, followed by training, validation, and testing of these models.
3. **Results Analysis**: Analyzing the performance of models and their ability to handle polysemous words in Kannada.
4. **Reporting and Documentation**: Documenting the results, insights, and methodologies to share with the wider community.

## Expected Outcomes

- A unique, high-quality annotated dataset for Kannada NLP tasks.
- AI models specifically tailored to handle Kannada text.
- Open-source code and datasets, which will be made available on GitHub for public use.
- Academic publications contributing to the cross-lingual NLP research community.
